## Stock Oracle

Stock Oracle is a web application designed to predict stock prices using machine learning, specifically integrating Keras and LSTM models. Built with Django, Django REST Framework, and React, it provides insightful forecasts based on 100-day and 200-day moving averages, key indicators used by stock analysts to guide investment decisions.

### Features

 - Machine Learning Predictions: Utilizes LSTM models for accurate stock price forecasting.

 - Moving Average Analysis: Leverages 100-day and 200-day moving averages to provide valuable insights.

### Virtualization

 - Closing Price: Line chart of the stock's historical closing prices.

 - 100-Day Moving Average: Smoothens short-term price fluctuations.

 - 200-Day Moving Average: Identifies long-term trends.

 - Final Prediction Plot: Compares predicted prices with original prices.


### Model Evaluation

 - Mean Square Error (MSE): Average squared difference between actual and predicted values.

 - Root Mean Square Error (RMSE): Square root of MSE.

 - R-Squared (RÂ²): Measures how well the predictions fit the actual data.



## Technologies Used
